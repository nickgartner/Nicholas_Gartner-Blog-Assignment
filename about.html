          <h2>About my Diary:</h2>
            <br>
            <p>My Web Diary is a website designed for documenting information on a week by week basis.<br> <br>
              I am currently using the diary to document my progress in learning Web Design. <br> <br>
              Each webpage within the diary represents one weeks worth of content learned about Web Design.<br> <br>

                Each of these pages contains a title describing the main focus of the week, written content explaining what was learnt and an image to complement the explanation.<br> <br>
