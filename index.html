      <p class="blog-p"> For my first week of class I had a scheduling mix up, so to catch up I watched a series of youtube tutorials in order to determine the the basics of what HTML & CSS are and what they do. HTML is used for defining the content of a website. Whereas CSS is for styling and arrangement of the content within a website. HTML has a small number of tags necessary to be memorised. I used this time to familiarise myself with these HTML Tags. <br> <br>

      Html head contains information about the webpage eg. Links to CSS and Java script, webpage title. <br> <br>
                
      Html body contains the content of the webpage.

        <h2 class="blog-title"> What is CSS?</h2>
      

      <p class="blog-p"> For my second week of class I have been looking at the fundamentals of CSS. CSS is used to style the contents of webpages altering the visual representation of content in a webpage. <br> <br>

        CSS follows the format of: Selector{	<br>
          property: value;} <br> <br>

          eg.Body{ <br>
              background: red;} <br> <br>
              
              Css files needs to be linked via head of html page <br> <br>
              
              eg.<link> href=“styles/main.css” <br> <br>
              
              Can add specificity to CSS via creating a class which can be added to anhtml tag Class=“Secondary” to html code and then use .Secondary as a selector in css to add attributes. <br> <br>

              or can also add specificity to one specific item by giving it an id=“x”.

      <p class="blog-p"> Divs are containers that are used to create layouts, by putting html content inside of themand then altering the properties of the container.<br> <br>
              
        Classes and ids are used to add specificity to divs as well as the content inside of the divs allowing for the control of the container as well as controlling the contentwithin the div.<br> <br>
        
        Divs are transformed by adding padding and margins to them: <br> <br>
        
        Margins are the empty space that surrounds an element. <br> <br>
        
        Padding is the empty space that surrounds an element which includes the background of the element.

      <p class="blog-p"> For my Assignment 1 project I created two sets of wireframes to help students with the planning of their degrees and their paper selection process.  <br> <br>
              
        Accompanying these wireframes I included a report which outlined an analysis of user motivations and needs within the website. <br> <br>

        The wireframes clearly communicated the purpose of the website and I provided a commentary on the start-to-end flow of the design. 
        <br> <br>
        I also explained the decisions made in the creation of each wireframe and how they impact users. <br> <br>

        At the end of the report a comparison of the two design options is made with a final recommendation, with reasoning, of the preferred option.

      <p class="blog-p"> For assignment 2 we were organised into groups.
        
        I established a timeline in order to keep to a schedule and ensure that completing the assignment was manageable we have 6 weeks to complete it.<br> <br>

        I pitched my concept for a website being related to helping people upskill at cooking during lockdown. <br> <br>
        
        I created 3 different personas to determine what the needs of users would be that need to be addressed in the website. <br> <br>
        
        This made me realise that I need to incorporate characteristics of different recipes into information displayed on images in recipe gallery in response to this. <br> <br>
        
        Created a User flow diagram/wireframes in order to visualise this within Figma.

      <p class="blog-p">

      Using the information contained within our Userflow Diagrams we created wire and blockframes for our website. <br> <br>
                
      This allowed us to conceptualise different ways the website could be physically represented to service our users. <br> <br>

      We are still working out our group style and currently are taking a collective approach whereby we each tackle the same task and then bring our collective works together in order to determine what the final product should look like. <br> <br>

      In this way we each created our own wireframes and then merged them into one final set of wireframes.

      <p class="blog-p"> This week we used our wireframes as a template to create a draft prototype for how our website could look. <br> <br>

        Each one of our group members contributed some ideas towards how the style of the website should look. <br> <br>

        While we also developed mobile versions of our prototype and began to understand the different functionalities of designing within Figma.

      <p class="blog-p"> This week we had our Critique Session in class and as well as that we conducted some user testing. <br> <br>

      This critique session was invaluable as it gave us much needed feedback on how to improve the website and what was wrong with the design both functionally and physically. <br> <br>

      I took notes from this session and personally redesigned the whole prototype. I organised the design refinements in relation to each page and also general design revisions to the website as a whole. <br> <br>

      <p class="blog-p"> This week I totally redesigned the website.<br> <br>

        I organised all the different aspects of the 1st prototype.<br> <br>

        The home page needed a clear mission statement and to be given a stronger website identity. It needed a key, and a feature recipe. <br> <br>
 
        Similiarly the About Page needed a more clear pupose with clear headings and greater unity and less block elements in the design.
        <br> <br>

        The Gallery Page needed to be seperated into individual pages with links joining each other by category type, it also needed to look much more sleek, the hovers needed to be changed and to look more subtle and professional. <br> <br>

        The Recipe Page needed to have all the information consolidated together into one cohesive block and to fix the amount of white space in the page as well as adding print/download buttons.

      <p class="blog-p"> With 2 weeks left we needed to convert our finished Figma Prototype into a fully coded website.<br> <br>

      To do this I realised and was advised by Blaine that I needed to delegate responsibilities, I took somewhat of a leadership role and designated out roles for people and gave people the option that if they didn't like the roles then they had the option to propose an alternative. <br> <br>
                
      Daniel took the role as Git-Master, I was in charge of creating the presentation, Jamie was in charge of the final report, and Mavis was in charge of helping Daniel with the final coding of the website. <br> <br>

      We each took on the responsibility of coding 1 page from the website.

      <p class="blog-p"> In the final week of our Web Design class we have been franticly working to get the website together. <br> <br>

      We found that the most difficult task was creating our web pages so that they could be displayed on both webpages and mobile phones. <br> <br>
                
      This week I have also been very busy with looking over the projet as a whole and consolidating our process and final product into a presentation.
